This project was to have a game that allowed you to search words on a grid.

Below are a few screenshots of the code:

The technology that we used was SignalR, a SQL database, and Razor Pages. It was really difficult to figure out how to connect the front end code to SignalR, and how to query the database without extending the time it took to keep playing the game. But we were able to figure out how to pair the connection, and also make quick queries and stored procedures that made it work.

I worked on the functionality that made it work with SignalR. I built most of the SignalR functions, put mock data in them while the frontend worked on it, and then I also filled it with the rest of the logic after it was working on the front end. And then I helped troubleshoot frontend issues, and design the database.

Snippets of code I worked on are posted below:
